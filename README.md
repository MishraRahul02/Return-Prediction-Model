# Return-Prediction-Model
I have build Full End to End Data Science and Machine learning Project that'll help to grow the business and i have visualized the data into power bi .
so in this project i downloaded a sales dataset from kaggle and there is only sales about columns exstied so i just created more column with the help of pandas and numpy. columns like return return data return type stauts etc. then i map the returnd columns into return and not return values like 20% return and 80% not return. then i use sklearn and used random forest model for more accurecy instead of logistic reggression 
and after trainf my model i downloaded my csv file and import it inot power bi and build two dashboard 1st one is Sales Overview and 2nd the main one is Return Prediction dashboad. in my dashboard i have coverd all the aspect and inshghts that a clien or a CEO want to see....
