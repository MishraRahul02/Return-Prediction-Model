I have build Full End to End Data Science and Machine learning Project that'll help to grow the business and i have visualized the data into power bi .
so in this project i downloaded a sales dataset from kaggle and there is only sales about columns exstied so i just created more column with the help of pandas and numpy. columns like return return data return type stauts etc. then i map the returnd columns into return and not return values like 20% return and 80% not return. then i use sklearn and used random forest model for more accurecy instead of logistic reggression
